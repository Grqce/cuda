# Cuda
CUDA was originally a PSD web design template. I decided to waste my time and convert it to HTML! Work in progress, keep reading for more.

*Warning: I made this a very long long time ago so the code is probably really bad and messy*

# Progress
As of today's upload date, this project has 1 html page, is not responsive, and has no footer.

# Credit
You can download the original template here. [https://graphicburger.com/cuda-single-page-portfolio-template/]

The file is in a .PSD format, but you can use online photo editing websites like https://www.photopea.com to open the file and edit it.
