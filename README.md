# Cuda
CUDA was originally a PSD web design template. I decided to waste my time and convert it to HTML! Work in progress, keep reading for more.

# Progress
As of today's upload date, this project has 1 html page, is not responsive, and no footer.

# Contributions
You can download the original template here. [https://www.codexcoder.com/products/cuda-one-page-html-template/?v=fbd25224d617]

The file is in a .PSD format, but you can use online photo editing websites like https://www.photopea.com to open the file and edit it.
Feel free to contribute to this! I started this project when I was learning HTML. Please be self-respecting human beings when editing.

# Final Words

Thanks. That is all.
